# sdn-raspberrypi
SDN network using Raspberry pi 3 as a controller. Measuring the network performance using iperf3.

# Description
In this project we try reimplemented back the research paper VPLS on SDN with raspberry pi. As we are limited in term of hardware resources, we are using virtual devices for all the hardware. 
We are using Oracle VirtualBox to create virtual Raspberry Pi and also mininet to create a virtual topology that we will used.
In this repository, there are research paper, proposal, and also the report for our project. In the report, all the progress from installation till the results are recorded.

This project was created for the course SKR3408 Software Defined Network on my fifth semester in study.
